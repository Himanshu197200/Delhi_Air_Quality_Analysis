# Delhi_Air_Quality_Analysis
This project studies Delhi’s air quality using data mining to find real patterns in AQI, pollution levels, and weather. It reveals when and where pollution rises, spots unusual spikes, and helps predict trends so people and policymakers can better understand and respond to Delhi’s air pollution.
